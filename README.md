## Install

```bash
npm install -g  pandemic
```

You will also need to install [Pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases) (v2.1.1 or above) and [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) if it's not already the case.

## Roadmap

- [x] propose publishing templates
- [x] include pandoc filters in the publishing pipeline
- [x] possibility to add custom scaffolds and publishing recipes from git
- [x] add possibility in recipes ~for pre and~ post publishing hooks
- [ ] automated image management to facilitate publication (extraction, reformating, isolated legends, etc) -> see [pandemic-image](https://github.com/lionel-rigoux/pandemic-image)
- [ ] provide tools to process revisions and suggestions (diff display, selective merge, etc.)?
